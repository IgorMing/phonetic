# Phonetic Algorithm

At first, lets check if you have the node installed.

`node -v`

Getting started
===

Install dependencies (in this case, only express server)

`yarn install`

or (if you don't have yarn npm-cli)

`npm i`

Now, lets run our application with the following:

`node phonetic.js word1 word2 < word_dict.txt`

That's it!

This code is also available on github repository.
